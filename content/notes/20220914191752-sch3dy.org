* The nature of matter

** Separation

Separating mixtures.

*** Physical separation

 * Separated by forces
 * In contrast to chemical separation

**** Mechanical physical separation

 * Motion
 * Gravity

***** Density separation

The parts with more density go down.

***** Centrifugation

Uses a centrifuge - a large spinning machine - to spin the material. The densest particles want to stay where they are, whereas the least dense particles will go up easily.

**** Non-mechanical physical separation

 * Heat

***** Chromatography

Lab stuff, basically.

***** Distillation

Separates by using different vapor pressures. For example, boiling salt water will evaporate the water, leaving the salt sediment below.

***** Froth flotation

Industrial process, generally used for mining. Given a solution of dissolved things, add oil and water that makes it froth.

*** Chemical separation
* Early models of the atom

** Dalton's atomic theory

 * All matter is made of indivisible atoms.
 * All atoms of a given element are identical in mass and properties.
 * Compounds are formed by a combination of different atoms.
 * A chemical reaction is a rearrangement of atoms.

** The Thomson model

Thomson's model was the plum pudding model. He thought that an atom was a blob with a bunch of negatively charged electrons inside.

** Rutherford's contribution

 * Gold foil experiment
 * Led to the discovery of the nucleus

** Today's view of the atom

+-----+--- ------+-----+
| Type | Charge | Relative mass |

| Protons P+ | 1+ | 1 |

| Neutrons n0 | 0 | 1 |

* Atomic class

Mass number A
Atomic number 2
Element symbol X

 * Atomic number = # of protons (not really)
 * Mass - protons = neutrons

* Isotopes

 * Although all nuclei in an atom has the same atomic number, there's variation in mass.
 * Sometimes we have a different # of neutrons
 * These are called isotopes
 * E.g.: Carbon has a mass of 12.1. It has 6 protons, so there's extra left. This is carbon-12, 99.89% of the world's carbon.
 * This percentage number is called isotopic abundance.
 * The atomic mass written on the periodic table is actually just the average atomic mass between all isotopes of an element.
 * NOTE: this is the **world**'s, but not the universe's.

** Calculating average atomic mass

Calculate the average atomic mass of magnesium.

Magnesium-24, Mg-25, Mg-26 have isotopic abundances of 78.7%, 10.1%, and 11.2%, respectively.

Average atomic mass = average(for_all_isotopes(abundance * mass))
                    = 24 * .787 + 25 * .101 + 26 * .112
                    = 24.325 amu = average atomic mass

*** How to measure which isotope is present

 * Mass spectrometer
 * A charged particle would move differently in the presence of a magnetic field.
 * Measure the deflection, based on that figure out the isotope.

* The quantum atomic theory

 * Rutherford's ideas were criticized immediately.
 * It would mean that all matter collapses.
 * Plank comes up with this equation: E=hv
 * Energy is either absorbed or emitted, and it happens in a whole amount called a quantum.
 * You can only take 1 marble from a bag, not half or a quarter.

** Bohr and the Bohr Light Spectrum experiment

 * Bohr finds BLS
 * Comes up with a new postulate: there are only certain levels of energy. This is called the quantum number.

When an electron gets energy, it moves up. But if it can't hold on anymore, it jumps down, and releases light.

 * Echo color on the spectrometer represented the movement of an electron.
 * This is the start of the quantum theory.
 * However, this only worked with H.

* Beyond Borh - the quantum mechanical model of the atom

 * Bohr's theory established the concept of fixed atomic energy levels.
 * De Broglie said that if waves could behave like particles, can particles too behave like waves?

   \lambda = \frac{h}{mv}, where \lambda = wavelength
 * So... any particle has a whole # wavelength. It is inversely related to atomic mass.

** Heisenberg

 * Invented the uncertainty principle. You can never know both an electron's position and velocity simultaneously.
 * The more we know about one, the less we know about the other.

** Schroedinger

 * Described the electron as a pure wave.
 * Says that we can only ever find the probability of the shape of an electron.
 * Described electrons as clouds: orbitals.
 * Orbitals are 3D spaces with shapes, sizes, and locations.
 * Not to be confused with the orbit in Bohr-Rutherford.
