#+title: Sine Law

Sine Law is the law that says that $\frac{\sin{A}}{a} = \frac{\sin{B}}{b} = \frac{\sin{C}}{c}$. This applies to *all triangles*.

** Example 1

Problem: Given a triangle with $A=1$, $a=20$, $C=1$, calculate $c$.

Solution: Use Sine Law to create a ratio from $A$, $a$, $C$, and $c$. Plug in $A$, $a$, $C$, and solve for $c$.

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
  \frac{\sin{A}}{a}  = \frac{\sin{C}}{c}\\
  \frac{\sin{1}}{20} = \frac{\sin{1}}{c}\\
  (\frac{\sin{1}}{20})/(\sin{1}) = c\\
  20 = c
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Extended problem: can you solve for the rest of the triangle? Find $B$ and $b$.

Extended solution: The fasted way to find this is to use the [[id:cdbfdc77-93bb-4dd9-bc2c-ee45ef644ace][Sum of angles]] law to find $b$, then solve for $B$ with Sine Law.
