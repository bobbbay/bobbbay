#+title: Sequences and series

** Sequences

A sequence is a set of numbers.

The first term of a sequence is represented by $t_1$, the second term by $t_2$, and so on. For example, in the sequence $1, 4, 9, 16, ...$, $t_1=1$ and $t_3=9$. Therefore, the general term of this sequence - something that describes each term - is represented by $t_n=n^2$. In function form, it's written as $f(n) = n^2$ (pronounced: $f$ of $n$ is $n$ squared).

** Common difference ($d$)

The common difference is the difference between any two successive terms, i.e. $d=t_{n}-t_{n-1}$.

** Arithmetic sequences

The general arithmetic sequence is written as:

\begin{align*}
    t_1 &= a\\
    t_2 &= a + d\\
    t_3 &= a + 2d\\
    &...\\
    t_{68} &= a + 67d\\
    &...\\
    t_n &= a + (n - 1)d\\
\end{align*}

*** Example 1

Problem: Find $t_{10}$ for the arithmetic sequence $2, 6, 10, ...$.

Solution: solve for $d$, create the arithmetic sequence, plug in $n=10$.

\begin{align*}
    a &= 2\\
    n &= 10\\
    d &= 6-2\\
      &= 4
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
    t_n &= a + (n-1)d\\
    t_n &= 2 + 4(n-1)\\
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
    t_{10} &= 2 + (4)(9)\\
    t_{10} &= 36\\
\end{align*}
